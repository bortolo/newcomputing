In this Git repository you can find many different deployments of AWS resources. You will use mainly terraform to provision the resources and some ansible scripts to configure them.

If it is the first time that you hear about terraform start from [here](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) to have an end-to-end view on this sofware.

If you are a beginner using terraform on AWS, have a look to [this](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aws-build) brief guide about terraform. 

Inside the ***terraform_test_AWS*** folder you can start to play with the first ***examples*** to practice with terraform.

***Note:*** we are extensively using these terraform [modules](../modules_AWS) in all the deployments. Please refer to the original git repositories to get the most updated version of these modules. It is possible that the module stored in this respository are slightly different from the original one due to some code customizations.
